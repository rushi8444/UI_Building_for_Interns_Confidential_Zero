"""Persistence-weighted support / resistance from the resting order book.

Picking the single largest level in the current snapshot is a poor S/R signal:
a spoof that flashes 20k shares for two seconds outscores a genuine 5k wall that
has absorbed everything thrown at it for four minutes. Traders read the second
one as support precisely *because* it has held.

So a level is scored by the liquidity-time it has accumulated - the size summed
over every column it was resting in, i.e. share-seconds - rather than by its
instantaneous size. Standing size wins over flashes automatically, with no
special-casing.

Three qualifiers keep the output honest:

  * still resting  - a level absent from the newest book is history, not a level
                     price is about to meet.
  * minimum hold   - a level seen in only a column or two has no track record
                     yet, whatever its size.
  * hysteresis     - the chosen level only changes when a challenger clearly
                     beats it. A line that flips between two adjacent prices
                     every frame is unreadable, and traders anchor to a level
                     for as long as it holds.
